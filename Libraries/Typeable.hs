-- | The standard Haskell module "Data.Typeable" only provides
-- instances for tuples up to length 7. Since we need larger tuples,
-- we provide the missing instances here. 
-- 
-- Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do this portably; once the
-- instances get added to "Data.Typeable", we must remove them here.
-- 
-- Please note: type instances do not generate documentation, so there
-- is nothing here to document. Please click on \"Source\" above to
-- see the source code.

module Libraries.Typeable where

import Data.Typeable

-- Note: we use scoped type variables so that the typerep is constant;
-- it can be computed at compile time. Same trick as in
-- Data.Typeable.Internal.
